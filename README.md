Academic achievements are indeed crucial for both personal and career advancement and societal progress. However, the current method of issuing, storing, and exchanging academic credentials is plagued by inefficiencies, primarily due to its paper-based nature (Smith,2020). Annually, a significant amount of fraud occurs in the realm of academic qualifications, ranging from simple forgeries to the operation of diploma mills (Jones,2019). To address these challenges, a complete digital transformation is imperative, and blockchain technology offers a promising solution. By leveraging Public Key Cryptography (PKC) and decentralized credential storage, blockchain technology ensures total transparency and verifiable proofs of ownership (Brown,2021).
